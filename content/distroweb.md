Summary: Distroweb

The idea for [DistroWeb](https://github.com/sudowhoami/distroweb/) came to [Rose Ames](https://github.com/sudowhoami/) and I during a [late-night Japanese curry dinner](http://www.gogocurryusa-ny.com/) after having just seen [Richard Stallman's talk at the Cooper Union](http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/events/164513032/) on free software. We didn't implement any ideas from the talk itself, but it got us in a mood of thinking about distributed systems. We chatted about what major centralized systems could be decentralized. A few major examples came to mind:

* Website hosting. Frequently, content is hosted on a single server or set of servers and served from that centralized location to clients who ask for it. When content is mirrored, a central location points to mirrors, which is quite easy to target or disrupt.
* The [domain name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) system - essentially, it's controlled by a small committee of developers from seven different countries, who all meet in data centres in the US a few times a year to renew the keys for the root DNS server.
* Search is also centralized, mostly around such companies as Google.

DistroWeb is essentially an [overlay network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network) over the Internet that imitates the World Wide Web, serving documents to browsers from remote machines that are uniquely identified by a URL - currently, that URL is `http://localhost:1234/distroweb/<hash>`, with `<hash>` serving as a unique identifier for each page. Right now, a lot of the functionality is hardcoded, but we're looking to fix that later in the Hacker School batch. Installation requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and is quite simple:

    > git clone git://github.com/sudowhoami/distroweb/
    > cd distroweb
    > node distroweb.js
    Welcome to distroWeb!  Spinning up servers...
    Proxy:  Listening on port 1234
    Server:  Listening on port 12345
    DHT:  Listening on port 54321
    All servers started ok

Once the server is running, users can browse DistroWeb by visiting pages encoded in the above format. (At the time of initial writing, we haven't implemented a lot of features like bootstrapping a person's initial list of peers, or implementing [TCP hole punching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_hole_punching), so fetching documents might require a bit of code-diving â€” however, I'm documenting here what we have left to write and will add addenda as these features are coded and DistroWeb gets closer to "release".)

# How DistroWeb works, present and future

The following is a combination of documentation and design spec, with the intention of shifting the points here from the latter into the former category as the remaining DistroWeb functionality gets coded, probably in early April.

## High-level design

A DistroWeb node is initialized by executing the file `distroweb.js`, which serves as a wrapper file that starts three servers - distroProxy, which receives HTTP GET requests from the browser, distroServer, which handles content delivery (in conjunction with distroClient) between nodes based on requests using the distroWeb protocol, and the DHT, a distributed hash table which is used to look up metadata about a requested hash (including, crucially, which nodes are "seeding" that hash, so that the distroClient can issue requests to that node).

## Distributed hash table

One of the core concerns we had when writing DistroWeb is that we wanted to reduce our reliance on centralized servers as much as possible. We took our inspiration from distributed protocols (most notably [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)).
